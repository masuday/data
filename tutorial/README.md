This repository has a dataset used in *Introduction to BLUPF90 suite programs*, a tutorial of BLUPF90 programs.
The documentation is available at [the BLUPF90 official wiki](http://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=documentation).

The main dataset is in `examples` which has derived from the raw files in `rawfiles`.

- `examples`
   - `quick_tour` for *Quick tour of BLUPF90*
   - `renumf90` for *Data preparation with RENUMF90*
   - `variance_components` for *Variance component estimation*
   - `large_scale` for *Large-scale evaluation*
   - `genomic_analysis` for *Practical genomic analysis*

It does not have the data for *Various models*; this chapter uses the examples from Mrode's book
which is copyrighted. Please see the book and make your own data set.
